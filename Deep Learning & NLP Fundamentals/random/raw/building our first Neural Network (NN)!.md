We're going to build a simple **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, also known as a **feedforward neural network**. This is the most basic type of neural network where information flows in only one direction, from the input layer, through hidden layers (if any), to the output layer.

Here's a conceptual diagram of what we're aiming for with our MNIST classifier:

```
Input Layer (784 units)
   / | \
  /  |  \
Hidden Layer (128 units, ReLU activation)
  \  |  /
   \ | /
Output Layer (10 units)
```

Let's dive into the code to define this architecture using PyTorch's `torch.nn` module.

#### **Step 4: Building the Neural Network (MLP)**

In PyTorch, neural networks are typically defined as classes that inherit from `torch.nn.Module`. This class provides all the fundamental functionalities for building neural networks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn # nn contains all the modules we'll use to build our network
import torch.nn.functional as F # F contains activation functions and other useful operations

# Define the Neural Network class
class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):
    # The __init__ method defines the layers of our network
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleMLP, self).__init__() # Call the constructor of the parent class (nn.Module)

        # Input layer (784 units) to Hidden layer (128 units)
        # nn.Linear is a module that applies a linear transformation: y = xA^T + b
        # In our case, it's a fully connected layer where every input unit is connected to every output unit.
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128) # 28*28 = 784, because each MNIST image is 28x28 pixels.

        # Hidden layer (128 units) to Output layer (10 units)
        # The output layer has 10 units because there are 10 possible digits (0-9).
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    # The forward method defines how data flows through the network
    def forward(self, x):
        # Flatten the input image from 28x28 to a 1D vector of 784 elements
        # -1 means infer the batch size automatically.
        x = x.view(-1, 28 * 28)

        # Apply the first linear transformation (fc1)
        # Then apply the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function
        # F.relu(x) is a common activation function that introduces non-linearity.
        # Without non-linearity, a deep network would just be a single linear transformation.
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))

        # Apply the second linear transformation (fc2)
        # No activation function is applied here yet, as it's common to apply
        # the activation (e.g., softmax for probabilities) later during the loss calculation.
        x = self.fc2(x)

        return x

# Create an instance of our network
model = SimpleMLP()

# Print the model architecture (useful for checking layers)
print(model)

# Move the model to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU)
# If a GPU is available, we'll use it for faster computation.
# Otherwise, we default to the CPU.
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device) # .to() moves the model's parameters and buffers to the specified device

print(f"\nModel moved to: {device}")
```

Let's break down this code carefully:

- **`import torch.nn as nn`**: We import the `nn` module, which contains all the building blocks for neural networks (like layers, activation functions, etc.).
    
- **`import torch.nn.functional as F`**: This module contains common functions that are not associated with specific layers but are often used in the `forward` pass (like `relu`).
    
- **`class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):`**:
    
    - We define a class `SimpleMLP` that inherits from `nn.Module`. This is the standard way to define models in PyTorch.
- **`def __init__(self):`**:
    
    - This is the constructor where you define the **layers** of your neural network.
    - `super(SimpleMLP, self).__init__()`: Always call the constructor of the parent class (`nn.Module`).
    - `self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128)`:
        - `nn.Linear` represents a **fully connected layer** (also known as a dense layer). It performs a linear transformation on the input data (y=xAT+b).
        - The first argument (`28 * 28` which is 784) is the **input size** of this layer. Since each MNIST image is 28x28 pixels, and we'll flatten it into a single vector, it will have 784 features.
        - The second argument (`128`) is the **output size** of this layer, meaning it will have 128 neurons (or units) in this hidden layer.
    - `self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)`:
        - This is our **output layer**.
        - It takes the 128 outputs from the previous hidden layer as its input.
        - It produces 10 outputs, one for each possible digit (0-9). For classification tasks, the number of output units typically matches the number of classes.
- **`def forward(self, x):`**:
    
    - This method defines the **forward pass** of your network â€“ how data flows from the input to the output.
    - `x = x.view(-1, 28 * 28)`:
        - Our input `x` (a batch of images) initially has a shape like `[batch_size, 1, 28, 28]` (batch size, color channels, height, width).
        - The `view()` method is used to **reshape** the tensor. We need to flatten the 1x28x28 image into a 1D vector of 784 elements for the `nn.Linear` layer.
        - `-1` in `view()` means "infer this dimension". So, if we have 64 images in a batch, it will reshape `[64, 1, 28, 28]` to `[64, 784]`.
    - `x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))`:
        - First, `self.fc1(x)` applies the linear transformation defined by our first layer (`fc1`).
        - Then, `F.relu()` applies the **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** activation function element-wise to the output of `fc1`. ReLU is defined as f(x)=max(0,x). It introduces non-linearity, which is crucial for neural networks to learn complex patterns. Without it, stacking linear layers would still just result in a single linear transformation.
    - `x = self.fc2(x)`:
        - Finally, the output of the hidden layer is passed through the second linear layer (`fc2`).
        - Notice there's **no activation function** here (`F.relu`, `F.softmax`, etc.). For classification problems with `CrossEntropyLoss` (which we'll use next), it's common practice _not_ to apply a `softmax` activation in the `forward` pass of the model itself. The `CrossEntropyLoss` function in PyTorch internally applies `softmax` (or `log_softmax`) for numerical stability.
    - `return x`: The final output of the network, which will be a tensor of shape `[batch_size, 10]`, where each row represents the "raw scores" or "logits" for each of the 10 classes for a given image.
- **`model = SimpleMLP()`**: This creates an instance of our neural network.
    
- **`print(model)`**: This is super helpful! It prints a summary of your model's layers and their order.
    
- **`device = torch.device(...)`**: This checks if a **GPU** (Graphics Processing Unit) is available. If `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `True`, it means you have a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU, and PyTorch can use it for much faster computations. Otherwise, it defaults to using the **CPU** (Central Processing Unit).
    
- **`model.to(device)`**: This line moves all the parameters (weights and biases) of your neural network from the CPU to the GPU (or keeps them on the CPU if no GPU is available). This is essential for training on the GPU.

Scar:

I have a few questions. First, does fc2 rely on fc1, so if fc1 doesn't exist, can we get fc2 or not? Second, you mentioned that no activation function is applied here yet for this line "x = self.fc2(x)." Why? Why didn't we use F.relu like fc1? Third, are there different transformations other than linear? fourth, and last one can we change the value 128 to something else or it wouldn't work?

Gemini:

Excellent questions, Scar! These are exactly the kind of critical thinking questions that help deepen your understanding. Let's tackle them one by one.

### 1. Does `fc2` rely on `fc1`? If `fc1` doesn't exist, can we get `fc2` or not?

**Yes, `fc2` absolutely relies on `fc1` in this specific network architecture.**

Here's why:

- **Sequential Flow:** Neural networks, especially feedforward ones like our `SimpleMLP`, process information sequentially. The output of one layer becomes the input to the next layer.
- **Input-Output Matching:**
    - Our `fc1` (the first fully connected layer) is defined as `nn.Linear(784, 128)`. It takes 784 input features and produces 128 output features.
    - Our `fc2` (the second fully connected layer) is defined as `nn.Linear(128, 10)`. This means it _expects_ 128 input features.
- **The `forward` Method:** Look at the `forward` method:

```python
def forward(self, x):
    x = x.view(-1, 28 * 28) # Input x is 784 features per image
    x = F.relu(self.fc1(x)) # Output of fc1 (and ReLU) is 128 features
    x = self.fc2(x)         # Input to fc2 MUST be 128 features, coming directly from the previous line
    return x
```

- The `x` that is passed into `self.fc2(x)` is the _output_ of `F.relu(self.fc1(x))`. If `fc1` didn't exist or produced a different number of outputs than `fc2` expects as inputs, PyTorch would throw an error because the dimensions wouldn't match.

So, in this `SimpleMLP`, `fc1` is the **hidden layer**, and `fc2` is the **output layer**. The hidden layer processes the input and provides a more abstract representation to the output layer, which then makes the final prediction.

### 2. Why no activation function on `fc2`? Why not `F.relu` like `fc1`?

This is a very common and important question in classification tasks!

You are absolutely correct that `fc1` uses `F.relu`. That's because `fc1` is a **hidden layer**. Hidden layers need non-linear activation functions (like ReLU) to enable the network to learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Without them, stacking multiple linear layers would simply result in one single linear layer, severely limiting the model's capacity.

For the **output layer** in a multi-class classification problem (like MNIST, where we have 10 classes), we typically do _not_ apply `ReLU` or any other non-linear activation directly on the output of the final `nn.Linear` layer **if we are using `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` as our loss function.**

Here's the detailed explanation:

- **`CrossEntropyLoss` Internally Applies Softmax:**
    - `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` is a special loss function in PyTorch that is designed for multi-class classification.
    - Crucially, it **combines two operations internally**:
        1. It applies the **softmax activation function** to the raw output (logits) of your neural network. Softmax converts a vector of arbitrary real numbers into a probability distribution, where each value is between 0 and 1, and all values sum to 1. This gives you the probability of an input belonging to each class.
        2. It then calculates the **negative log likelihood** (which is what cross-entropy loss essentially is) based on these probabilities and the true labels.
- **Numerical Stability:** Doing the softmax and the log likelihood calculation together within `CrossEntropyLoss` is generally more numerically stable than calculating softmax separately and then passing its output to a loss function that expects probabilities.
- **`ReLU` is for Hidden Layers:** `ReLU` is designed to introduce non-linearity for _intermediate_ representations. Applying `ReLU` to the output layer for classification would be problematic because `ReLU` truncates negative values to zero. This means it would remove any "negative evidence" for a class, and the outputs would not necessarily represent probabilities summing to 1.

**In summary:**

- **Hidden Layers:** Use non-linear activation functions (like `ReLU`, `Sigmoid`, `Tanh`) to learn complex patterns.
- **Output Layer (for Multi-Class Classification with `CrossEntropyLoss`):** No explicit activation function is needed on the `nn.Linear` output. The `CrossEntropyLoss` handles the `softmax` internally.
    - If you were _not_ using `CrossEntropyLoss` and wanted to get probabilities from your model (e.g., for prediction after training), you would manually apply `F.softmax(x, dim=1)` to the output of `fc2`.

### 3. Are there different transformations other than linear?

**Absolutely!** `nn.Linear` (fully connected layer) is just one type of layer (transformation) you can use in a neural network. There's a rich variety of others, each designed for specific types of data or tasks:

- **`nn.Conv2d` (Convolutional Layer):**
    - **Purpose:** The backbone of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, primarily used for image processing.
    - **How it works:** It applies filters (kernels) that slide across the input image to detect features like edges, textures, etc. It's excellent at capturing spatial hierarchies and is much more efficient for image data than fully connected layers.
- **`nn.MaxPool2d` (Max Pooling Layer):**
    - **Purpose:** Reduces the spatial dimensions (width and height) of feature maps, which helps to reduce the number of parameters and makes the model more robust to small shifts or distortions in the input.
- **`nn.RNN`, `nn.LSTM`, `nn.GRU` (Recurrent Layers):**
    - **Purpose:** Designed for sequential data like text, speech, or time series.
    - **How they work:** They have internal memory mechanisms that allow them to process sequences by taking into account previous inputs in the sequence.
- **`nn.Transformer` (Transformer Layer):**
    - **Purpose:** Revolutionized NLP (Natural Language Processing) and is the core of modern LLMs (Large Language Models) like **GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
    - **How it works:** Uses "attention mechanisms" to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing each element, capturing long-range dependencies efficiently.
- **`nn.BatchNorm1d`, `nn.BatchNorm2d` (Batch Normalization):**
    - **Purpose:** Helps stabilize and speed up the training of deep neural networks by normalizing the inputs to each layer.
- **`nn.Dropout` (Dropout Layer):**
    - **Purpose:** A regularization technique to prevent **overfitting**. It randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time, effectively making the network less reliant on any single neuron. (This is one of your bonus tasks!)

So, while `nn.Linear` is a fundamental building block, neural networks become very powerful and specialized by combining these different types of layers in creative ways.

### 4. Can we change the value `128` to something else, or it wouldn't work?

**Yes, you absolutely can change the value `128` to something else!**

- **What `128` represents:** It represents the **number of neurons (or units)** in our **hidden layer**. This is a design choice, often called a **hyperparameter**.
- **Impact of changing it:**
    - **Smaller number (e.g., 32, 64):** The model would have fewer parameters, making it faster to train and potentially less prone to **overfitting** (where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on new, unseen data). However, it might also have less capacity to learn complex patterns, leading to **underfitting** (where the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data).
    - **Larger number (e.g., 256, 512):** The model would have more parameters, giving it greater capacity to learn intricate relationships. This could lead to better performance on complex tasks. However, it would also be slower to train, require more memory, and be more susceptible to **overfitting** if you don't have enough data or proper regularization techniques.
- **Why `128` is a common choice:** For simple datasets like MNIST, `128` (or powers of 2 like 64, 256, 512) is a common starting point because it's a good balance of model capacity and computational efficiency. There's no single "correct" number; finding the optimal number of hidden units often involves experimentation and depends on the complexity of the dataset and the task.

The key is that if you change `128` in `self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)`, you **must also change the input size of `fc2`** to match the new output size of `fc1`. For example, if you change `fc1` to `nn.Linear(784, 256)`, then `fc2` must become `nn.Linear(256, 10)`. The input and output dimensions of connected layers must always match.

These were truly insightful questions, Scar! Keep them coming. Ready to move on to **Loss Functions and Optimizers** now that our network is defined?
