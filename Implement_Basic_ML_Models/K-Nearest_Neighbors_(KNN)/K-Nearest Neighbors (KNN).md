### **What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?**

- **Type:** It's a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks, though it's most commonly explained and applied for classification.
- **Lazy" Learning:** Unlike Linear or Logistic Regression, which build an explicit mathematical model during the `fit()` (training) phase, KNN doesn't actually "learn" anything from the training data in advance. It simply **memorizes** the entire training dataset. All the computation happens during the `predict()` (prediction) phase when a new data point comes in.
- **"Non-parametric":** It makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.

### **How KNN Works for Classification (Step-by-Step):**

Imagine you have a new, unlabeled data point that you want to classify (e.g., a new student's exam score and hours studied, and you want to predict if they'll pass or fail).

1. **Choose `k`:** First, you decide on a number `k`. This is the number of "neighbors" you want to consider. `k` is typically a small, odd integer (like 3, 5, or 7) to avoid ties in voting.
2. **Calculate Distance:** For this new, unlabeled data point, the algorithm calculates its **distance** to _every single data point_ in your entire **training dataset**.
	- **Common Distance Metric:** The most common distance metric is **Euclidean Distance**, which is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. Think of it like a ruler connecting two points on a graph.
3. **Find `k` Nearest Neighbors:** After calculating all distances, the algorithm identifies the `k` training data points that are **closest** to your new, unlabeled point.
4. **Vote (Majority Class):** Among these `k` nearest neighbors, the algorithm counts how many belong to each class. The class that gets the **most votes** is the predicted class for your new data point! It's a simple majority vote.

**Visualizing KNN:**

Imagine a scatter plot of your data points, colored by their class. When a new, uncolored point appears:

- If `k=3`, you draw a small circle around the new point that encompasses its 3 closest existing points.
- You then look at the colors (classes) of those 3 points. If 2 are blue and 1 is red, the new point is classified as blue.

### **Key Considerations & Hyperparameters:**

1. **The Value of `k`:**
    - **Small `k` (e.g., k=1):** Makes the model very sensitive to noise in the data and can lead to overfitting (complex decision boundaries).
    - **Large `k`:** Can smooth out decision boundaries and reduce the effect of noise, but might lead to underfitting if `k` is too large (considering neighbors too far away).
    - `k` is a hyperparameter you tune, often using cross-validation.

2. **Distance Metric:** While Euclidean distance is common, other metrics exist (e.g., Manhattan distance for grid-like movements). The choice can impact performance.

3. **Feature Scaling is CRUCIAL!**

	- Since KNN relies on distance calculations, features with larger scales will disproportionately influence the distance.
	- **Example:** If `hours_studied` is 0-20, but `exam_score` is 0-100, `exam_score` will dominate the distance calculation if not scaled.
	- Always **scale your features** (e.g., using `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler`) before applying KNN! You've already mastered this, so you're well-prepared!

### **Advantages and Disadvantages of KNN:**

**Advantages:**

- **Simple to understand and implement.**
- **No training time:** Because it's "lazy," there's no complex model to build during training.
- **Non-linear decision boundaries:** It can learn arbitrary decision boundaries, unlike linear models.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Prediction can be slow:** For large datasets, calculating the distance to _every_ training point for _every_ new prediction can be computationally expensive.
- **Sensitive to irrelevant features:** If your dataset has many features that don't influence the target, they will still participate in distance calculations and can mislead the model.
- **Memory-intensive:** It needs to store the entire training dataset.
- **Sensitive to the scale of features:** As discussed, requires scaling.

### **Implementing KNN with Scikit-learn**

The process remains consistent with the Scikit-learn API:

1. **Import:** `from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier`
2. **Instantiate:** `model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k_value)`
3.  **Train:** `model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
4. **Predict:** `y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)`
5. **Evaluate:** Use `accuracy_score`, `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix` (same as Logistic Regression for classification).

Let's use the same balanced synthetic dataset from your last exercise so you can focus on the KNN implementation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression # Just for the dataset setup
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier # The new model!
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# --- Synthetic Dataset (from previous exercise) ---
np.random.seed(42)
X_logistic_exercise = pd.DataFrame({
    'exam_score': np.random.normal(70, 10, 200),
    'hours_studied': np.random.normal(10, 3, 200)
})
linear_combination = (0.8 * X_logistic_exercise['exam_score'] + 1.2 * X_logistic_exercise['hours_studied']) - 60
prob_passed = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-linear_combination))
y_logistic_exercise = (prob_passed > 0.5 + (np.random.rand(200) - 0.5) * 0.2).astype(int)

# Use these for the KNN exercise:
X = X_logistic_exercise
y = y_logistic_exercise

print("Features (X head):\n", X.head())
print("\nTarget (y head):\n", y.head())
print(f"\nTarget distribution (0s vs 1s): {np.bincount(y)}")
print("\n----------------------------------------------------\n")
```

Does this explanation of KNN make sense? It's a very intuitive algorithm once you grasp the "nearest neighbors" idea!
