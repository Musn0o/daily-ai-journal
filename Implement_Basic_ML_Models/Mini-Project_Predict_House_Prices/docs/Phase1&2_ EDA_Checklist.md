## Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Data Loading & Shape

- [x] **Train and test data loaded successfully**
- [x] **Train shape:** (1460, 81)
- [x] **Test shape:** (1459, 80)

> **Note:**  
> If shapes differ, check for file path or data integrity issues. The test set does not include the `SalePrice` column.

---

### 2. Initial Data Glance (`.head()`)

- [x] **Columns and sample values look reasonable**
- [x] **No obvious data entry or formatting issues**

> **Note:**  
> Use this to spot glaring errors (e.g., shifted columns, strange values).

---

### 3. Data Types & Info (`.info()`)

- [x] **Categorical features (`object` dtype) and numerical features (`int`, `float`) identified**
- [x] **Columns with missing values are visible (non-null count < total rows)**

> **Note:**  
> Most missing values are in categorical columns (e.g., `PoolQC`, `Alley`, `Fence`).  
> Some columns may be numeric but represent categories (e.g., `MSSubClass`).

---

### 4. Summary Statistics (`.describe()`)

- [x] **Checked for outliers and zero-variance columns**
- [x] **Ranges for features like `YearBuilt`, `LotArea`, `GrLivArea` make sense**

> **Note:**  
> Look for min/max values that are suspicious (e.g., `LotArea` extremely large or small).  
> Columns with std=0 can be dropped.

---

### 5. Categorical & Numerical Columns

- [x] **Categorical columns list includes expected features**  
  (e.g., `Neighborhood`, `MSZoning`, `SaleCondition`)
- [x] **Numerical columns list includes expected features**  
  (e.g., `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `YearBuilt`)

> **Note:**  
> Some features (like `MSSubClass`) are numeric but should be treated as categorical.

---

### 6. Missing Values (Sorted)

- [x] **Identified columns with missing values**
- [x] **Most missing values are in categorical columns**
- [x] **Columns with >15-20% missing:**  
  - `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence`, `FireplaceQu`

> **Note:**  
> - High-missing columns may be dropped or imputed as "None".
> - For numerical columns with few missing values, impute with median or mean.
> - For categorical columns, impute with mode or "None".

---

### 7. Target Variable (`SalePrice`) Distribution

- [x] **Histogram plotted**
- [x] **Skewness and kurtosis printed**

> **Note:**  
> - `SalePrice` is typically right-skewed.  
> - If skewness > 1, consider log-transforming the target for modeling.
> - Outliers may affect model performance.

---

### 8. General Observations

- [x] **Noted features with suspicious or redundant values**
- [x] **Identified features needing special handling**  
  (e.g., `GarageYrBlt` with 0 for no garage, `MSSubClass` as categorical)

---

#### 🟢 **Key Takeaways from Your EDA**

- **Most missing values are in categorical columns**  
  → Impute with "None" or similar, or drop if not useful.
- **Some features are numeric but categorical in nature**  
  → Convert these to string/object type before encoding.
- **Target variable (`SalePrice`) is right-skewed**  
  → Consider log-transform for regression models.
- **No major data loading or formatting issues detected**  
  → Ready to proceed to preprocessing and feature engineering.

---

#### 📌 **Next Steps**

- Decide on imputation strategies for missing values.
- Convert numeric-categorical features to categorical dtype.
- Plan for encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical ones.
- Consider simple feature engineering (e.g., total square footage).

## Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

### 1. Drop High-Missing Columns

- [x] **Dropped columns with excessive missing values**  
  (e.g., `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence`, `FireplaceQu`)

> **Note:**  
> Dropping these columns reduces noise and simplifies imputation.

---

### 2. Impute Missing Values

- [x] **Categorical columns:** Imputed missing values with `'None'` or similar.
- [x] **Numerical columns:** Imputed missing values with median (robust to outliers).

> **Note:**  
> Imputing with consistent values prevents data leakage and maintains dataset integrity.

---

### 3. Convert Numeric-Categorical Features

- [x] **Converted features like `MSSubClass`, `MoSold`, `YrSold` to string/object dtype.**

> **Note:**  
> Ensures proper encoding and prevents models from interpreting these as ordinal.

---

### 4. Feature Engineering

- [x] **Created new features (e.g., `TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`).**

> **Note:**  
> Combining related features can improve model performance.

---

### 5. Target Transformation

- [x] **Applied log1p transformation to `SalePrice` to reduce skewness.**

> **Note:**  
> Log-transforming the target helps linear models and reduces the impact of outliers.

---

### 6. Encoding Categorical Variables

- [x] **Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.**
- [x] **Ensured train and test sets have aligned columns after encoding.**

> **Note:**  
> Alignment is crucial to prevent shape mismatches during prediction.

---

### 7. Scaling Numerical Features

- [x] **Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler` (excluding target).**

> **Note:**  
> Scaling is important for models sensitive to feature magnitude (e.g., linear regression).

---

### 8. Sanity Checks

- [x] **Checked shapes of processed train and test sets.**
- [x] **Verified no missing values remain in features.**
- [x] **Confirmed target variable is properly transformed and separated.**

> **Note:**  
> These checks ensure data is ready for modeling and prevent downstream errors.

## 🟢 **Key Takeaways from Preprocessing**

- **Data is now clean, consistent, and ready for modeling.**
- **All preprocessing steps are reproducible and based on EDA findings.**
- **Feature engineering and transformations are documented for transparency.**

---

## 📌 **Next Steps**

- Proceed to Phase 3: Model Selection, Training & Evaluation.
- Consider cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for robust results.
- Document model performance and interpretation.
