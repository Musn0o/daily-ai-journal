**Introducing Seaborn**

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Think of it as building on Matplotlib's capabilities to make certain types of plots, especially those involving statistical relationships, much easier to create and look good right out of the box!

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Still often used for customization like titles, labels, etc.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

**Let's look at the visualizations mentioned in your subtask:**

**1. Heatmaps (`sns.heatmap()`):**

- **When to use:** Heatmaps are excellent for visualizing the magnitude of a phenomenon as color in a 2D matrix. They are very commonly used to display **correlation matrices**, showing the correlation coefficient between pairs of numerical variables in a dataset.
    
- **Example:** Creating a heatmap of a correlation matrix.

```python
# Sample Data (as a DataFrame)
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'B': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
        'C': [2, 3, 4, 5, 1],
        'D': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
print("Correlation Matrix:")
print(correlation_matrix)

# Create a Figure and Axes (optional but good practice)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5)) # You might want to adjust figure size

# Create a heatmap
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', ax=ax)
# annot=True displays the correlation values on the heatmap
# cmap sets the color map (e.g., 'coolwarm' for diverging colors)

ax.set_title('Correlation Matrix Heatmap') # Use Matplotlib for the title

plt.show()
```

- The heatmap visually shows which variables are strongly correlated (colors close to extremes of the colormap) and which are weakly correlated (colors near the center).
    

**2. Pair Plots (`sns.pairplot()`):**

- **When to use:** Pair plots are great for visualizing the pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. It creates a grid of scatter plots for each pair of variables and often includes histograms or kernel density estimates along the diagonal. This helps you quickly spot trends, correlations, and distributions.
    
- **Example:** Creating a pair plot for our sample DataFrame.

```python
# Use the same DataFrame 'df' from the heatmap example

# Create a pair plot
sns.pairplot(df)

plt.show()
```

- This single line of code generates a matrix of plots! On the off-diagonal, you get scatter plots of each column against every other column. On the diagonal, you get a representation of the distribution of each individual column.
    

You can also add a `hue` parameter to `pairplot` to color the points based on a categorical variable in your DataFrame, which helps visualize relationships within different groups:

```python
# Example with a categorical 'category' column
data_with_category = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
                      'B': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0],
                      'C': [2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6],
                      'Category': ['X', 'Y', 'X', 'Y', 'X', 'Y']}
df_categorized = pd.DataFrame(data_with_category)

sns.pairplot(df_categorized, hue='Category')

plt.show()
```

Seaborn also offers many other powerful plotting functions for statistical data, such as `displot` (for distributions), `boxplot`, `violinplot`, `countplot` (for counts of categories), etc. We'll likely touch upon some of these as well.
