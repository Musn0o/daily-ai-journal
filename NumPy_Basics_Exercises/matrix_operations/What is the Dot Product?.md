The dot product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually vectors or 1D arrays) and returns a single number. It's a way of multiplying these sequences together to get a scalar (a single value).

**The Mathematical Formula:**

If you have two vectors, let's say `a` and `b`, both with `n` elements:

`a = [a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., a<0xE2><0x82><0x99>]` `b = [b₁, b₂, b₃, ..., b<0xE2><0x82><0x99>]`

The dot product of `a` and `b`, often written as `a · b` or sometimes as `<a, b>`, is calculated as the sum of the products of their corresponding elements:

`a · b = a₁*b₁ + a₂*b₂ + a₃*b₃ + ... + a<0xE2><0x82><0x99>*b<0xE2><0x82><0x99>`

**Simple Numerical Example:**

Let's say we have two vectors:

`a = [1, 3, 5]` `b = [2, 4, 6]`

The dot product of `a` and `b` would be:

`(1 * 2) + (3 * 4) + (5 * 6) = 2 + 12 + 30 = 44`

So, the dot product of `a` and `b` is 44.

**Dot Product of Matrices:**

The dot product can also be extended to matrices. When you take the dot product of two matrices, it's a bit more involved and relates to matrix multiplication. Specifically, to find the element in the i-th row and j-th column of the resulting matrix, you take the dot product of the i-th row of the first matrix with the j-th column of the second matrix.

**Why is the Dot Product Important in AI/ML?**

The dot product shows up everywhere in AI and machine learning! Here are just a few examples:

- **Neural Networks:** In neural networks, the calculations within each neuron often involve taking the dot product of the input values with a set of weights.
- **Similarity Calculations:** The dot product can be used to measure the similarity between two vectors. For example, in natural language processing, it can help determine how similar two documents are based on their word embeddings.
- **Linear Algebra Foundations:** It's a fundamental operation in linear algebra, which is the mathematical language of many AI algorithms.
- **Projections:** The dot product can be used to find the projection of one vector onto another.

**How to do it in NumPy:**

NumPy provides a couple of ways to calculate the dot product:

1. **Using `np.dot()` function:** This is the most common and explicit way. You pass the two arrays (vectors or matrices) as arguments.
    
2. **Using the `@` operator (since Python 3.5):** This is a more recent and often more readable way to perform matrix multiplication, which includes the dot product for vectors.
    

**Let's see it in NumPy code:**
```python
import numpy as np

# Example with 1D arrays (vectors)
vector_a = np.array([1, 3, 5])
vector_b = np.array([2, 4, 6])

dot_product_func = np.dot(vector_a, vector_b)
print(f"Dot product using np.dot(): {dot_product_func}")

dot_product_operator = vector_a @ vector_b
print(f"Dot product using @ operator: {dot_product_operator}")

# Example with 2D arrays (matrices)
matrix_x = np.array([[1, 2],
                     [3, 4]])
matrix_y = np.array([[5, 6],
                     [7, 8]])

matrix_product_func = np.dot(matrix_x, matrix_y)
print(f"\nMatrix product using np.dot():\n{matrix_product_func}")

matrix_product_operator = matrix_x @ matrix_y
print(f"\nMatrix product using @ operator:\n{matrix_product_operator}")
```

Notice that for 1D arrays, both `np.dot()` and the `@` operator give you the scalar dot product. For 2D arrays, they perform matrix multiplication, which internally uses the dot product of rows and columns.

So, that's the lowdown on the dot product! It's a way to combine two sequences of numbers into a single number based on the products of their elements.

#### I understood how it works for 1D and calculates it, but I cannot understand how it calculates the 2D how it returns
				[[19 22],
				 [43 50]]
#### I tried calculating it in too many different ways but I couldn't figure it out

It's not as straightforward as the element-wise multiplication in the 1D case. Let's break down how NumPy calculates the dot product (which is essentially matrix multiplication in this case) for your 2D arrays:

You had:

```python
matrix_x = np.array([[1, 2],
                     [3, 4]])
matrix_y = np.array([[5, 6],
                     [7, 8]])

matrix_product = np.dot(matrix_x, matrix_y)
# Result:
# [[19 22]
#  [43 50]]
```

Here's how each element in the resulting `matrix_product` is calculated:

**Element at row 0, column 0 (the top-left element, which is 19):**

This is the dot product of the **first row of `matrix_x`** and the **first column of `matrix_y`**.

- First row of `matrix_x`: `[1, 2]`
- First column of `matrix_y`: `[5, 7]` (think of this as a vertical vector)

The dot product is: `(1 * 5) + (2 * 7) = 5 + 14 = 19`

**Element at row 0, column 1 (the top-right element, which is 22):**

This is the dot product of the **first row of `matrix_x`** and the **second column of `matrix_y`**.

- First row of `matrix_x`: `[1, 2]`
- Second column of `matrix_y`: `[6, 8]` (again, think vertical)

The dot product is: `(1 * 6) + (2 * 8) = 6 + 16 = 22`

**Element at row 1, column 0 (the bottom-left element, which is 43):**

This is the dot product of the **second row of `matrix_x`** and the **first column of `matrix_y`**.

- Second row of `matrix_x`: `[3, 4]`
- First column of `matrix_y`: `[5, 7]`

The dot product is: `(3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 15 + 28 = 43`

**Element at row 1, column 1 (the bottom-right element, which is 50):**

This is the dot product of the **second row of `matrix_x`** and the **second column of `matrix_y`**.

- Second row of `matrix_x`: `[3, 4]`
- Second column of `matrix_y`: `[6, 8]`

The dot product is: `(3 * 6) + (4 * 8) = 18 + 32 = 50`

**In summary, for matrix multiplication (which is what `np.dot()` does for two matrices):**

To find the element in the i-th row and j-th column of the resulting matrix, you take the dot product of the i-th row of the first matrix with the j-th column of the second matrix.

It's like a row from the first matrix "slides" across a column from the second matrix, multiplying corresponding elements and then summing them up.
